            <h2 class="md-display-1">What is Open Legend?</h2>

            <div flex layout="row" layout-wrap>
              <p flex><em>Open Legend</em> is a tabletop roleplaying game (or RPG) in which the players play the part of mighty heroes and wicked villains in order to tell stories of epic proportion. In each game of Open Legend, the intrepid characters will fight mythic beasts, break ancient curses, unravel mysterious enigmas, discover treasures untold, and more. </p>
<!--               <p flex><iframe style="float: right; display: inline-block;" frameborder="0" height="420" scrolling="no" src="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/626049486/open-legend-open-source-rpg-and-amaureas-dawn-sett/widget/card.html?v=2" width="220"></iframe></p> -->

            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/190330/A-Star-Once-Fallen"><img class="home-banner-width" src="/assets/img/a_star_once_fallen_promo_banner.jpg" alt="A Star Once Fallen Adventure Free Download"></a>

            <p><em>Open Legend</em> is a streamlined system designed to let you tell big stories using small rules. The rules get complex when they need to, but never cumbersome, and wherever they could be cut out or simplified, they have been. Some of the highlights at the heart of <em>Open Legend</em> are explained below.</p>

            <p><a href="/core-rules/00-introduction"><md-icon size="md" aria-label="Link Icon" md-svg-icon="share"></md-icon>Or dive right in with the core rules </p>

<!-- <h2 class="md-display-1">Envision Your Hero</h2>
<strong>ONE ATTRIBUTE SYSTEM, ONE TYPE OF ROLL</strong>
<p>Build the character you want to play by choosing scores for your physical, mental, social, and supernatural attributes. These attributes are the basis for every action roll you’ll make, whether you’re attempting to slay a dragon, scale a treacherous cliff, or weave a powerful spell of thunder and lightning. It doesn’t matter what epic deed you want to accomplish, you’ll only ever need to make one kind of roll.</p>
 -->

            <h2 class="md-display-1">Tell Stories of Legend, Not Cliché</h2>
            <strong>UNHINDERED CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION</strong>
            <p>With Open Legend, every ability you choose for your character is a new decision. You're never required to choose from a short list, and every character has the potential to access every ability. The story you choose to tell with these abilities and how they manifest, is an opportunity to let your imagination run wild. Select the abilities that match your vision and ignore the ones that don’t. Or, you can get started with one of our quick builds. Either way, the best part is, it's fast and simple but still has lots of potential for intricate and complex characters, if that's what you're looking for. Complex and simple characters can both play a meaningful role in an Open Legend game. <a href="/core-rules/01-character-creation"><md-icon size="md" aria-label="Link Icon" md-svg-icon="share"></md-icon> Find out more about character building</a></p>

            </div>

<!-- <h2 class="md-display-1">Stand Out from the Rabble</h2>
<strong>FEATS TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR PATH</strong>
<p>While your attributes determine how smart, strong, or sociable you are, you really get to showcase how your character stands out from the rest by selecting feats. Feats distinguish how your warrior with a Might score of 5 is different from the other guy with Might 5. They define you, for example, as a raging berserker, a stalwart paladin, or a swashbuckling pirate.</p>
 -->

          <h2 class="md-display-1">Smite Your Foes, Shield Your Friends</h2>
          <strong>BANES & BOONS FOR EVERY CHARACTERS</strong>

          <p><em>Open Legend</em> features a collection of banes and boons that any character can use as long as they possess the appropriate attributes. Banes allow you to stun your enemies, set them ablaze, or otherwise hinder them with devastating status effects. Boons are perks that you grant yourself or allies, such as magical healing, damage resistance, and flight. In <em>Open Legend</em>, no fighter is just a walking meat shield with a blade. He’s a trained combatant who can stun, blind, cripple, and hurl his foes across the battlefield. And when a sorceress summons an icy storm from the skies, she decides at the time of casting if she also wants it to slow, knockdown, or immobilize her enemies. <a href="/banes"><md-icon size="md" aria-label="Link Icon" md-svg-icon="share"></md-icon> See a list of banes</a></p>


          <h2 class="md-display-1">Roll Dice, Roll Lots of Dice</h2>
          <strong>DICE WITHOUT LIMIT</strong>
          <p>In <em>Open Legend</em>, dice explode! That means that whenever any die rolls maximum, you get to reroll it and add the new roll to your total, ad infinitum. We love to tell a good story, but rolling dice is just so much fun, we thought that occasionally, you should get to roll a lot of them. The volatile nature of exploding dice makes every roll count, and every session of <em>Open Legend</em> is full of tense moments when the tides can turn at a moment’s notice, for better or worse. <a href="/core-rules#h.bsxt6tn5jtf9"><md-icon size="md" aria-label="Link Icon" md-svg-icon="share"></md-icon> Learn more about the unified action roll system</a></p>
<!--
<h2 class="md-display-1">Failure is Never Just a Failure</h2>

<strong>EVERY ROLL MATTERS</strong>
<p>When you take action in <em>Open Legend</em>, you’ll always drive the story forward: whether your roll succeeds or fails. Success in any RPG feels good, but it’s the failed rolls that really bring <em>Open Legend</em> to life. Whenever you fail an action check, the GM chooses from two possible outcomes: either you succeed with a twist, or you fail but the story goes on. That means no stagnant, boring failures. No endless re-rolling of missed skill tests. Every roll matters.</p>

            </div>


            <h2 class="md-display-1">Craft Your Setting, Create Your World</h2>
            <strong>ANY GENRE, ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES</strong>
            <p>The core rules are written to reflect a high fantasy, sword and sorcery setting, but <em>Open Legend</em> was purposefully designed to be open to any genre. The mechanics of the game focus on effects rather than flavor so that your gaming table can tell whatever kind of story it wants. Struggle for survival in a post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland. Soar amidst the clouds on your crystal-powered airship in a steampunk inspired campaign of swashbuckling sky pirates. Explore an alien-infested space station abandoned at the edge of the universe. The possibilities are endless.</p>

            </div>

            <h2 class="md-display-1">Share the Legend</h2>
            <strong>OPEN SOURCE RULES</strong>
            <p>Yes, you can copy portions of the rules, share your unique character builds, invent your own feats, and write adventure modules or campaign settings.

            <p>If you have played roleplaying games in the past, you may be wondering What makes <em>Open Legend</em> worth my time? What makes it different?</p>

            <p>The secret’s in the title: Open. Everything about the game is about opening up the doors of possibility so that every table tells a story that is the stuff of legends. Here are a few of the possibilities that <em>Open Legend</em> offers.</p>

            <p><em>Open Legend</em>. You get to tell the story that you want to tell, with the characters you want to play. You aren’t tied down to specific class, archetype, or race combinations. The only limit is your imagination (and maybe the GM’s veto power). Rather than a list of set classes with a menu of skills to pick from, you start the game with attribute points that you spend as you wish to give your character the powers she needs.</p> -->
