<h1 id="chapter-3-banes-boons">Chapter 3: Banes &amp; Boons</h1>
<p>Banes and boons are a huge part of what makes Open Legend so open. They represent the endless possibilities of effects that your character can have on other characters beyond simply dealing damage. Banes are negative conditions that you inflict upon your foes, such as by stunning them, demoralizing them, or setting them on fire. Boons are the opposite: helpful effects that assist your allies by allowing them to fly, shrug off damage, or move with extraordinary speed.</p>
<p>Banes and boons are not tied to specific spells, attacks, or items. Any character can invoke any bane or boon as long as the character possesses a prerequisite attribute. Attribute prerequisites are meant to limit the power of banes and boons so that they scale as your character gains power. That is why, for example, your first level necromancer can invoke the <em>blindsight</em> boon with their Entropy attribute of 5, but won’t be able to invoke the <em>insubstantial</em> boon for themself or their allies until they gain enough experience to increase their Entropy to 7</p>
<h2 id="telling-your-story-with-banes-and-boons">Telling Your Story with Banes and Boons</h2>
<p>Because <em>Open Legend</em> focuses on separating the mechanics from the story, when you invoke a bane or boon, you get to decide what it looks like in the narrative. For example, did you <em>knockdown</em> a foe with an agile sweep kick, a herculean shove, or a telekinetic thrust? When you grant your allies <em>resistance</em>, do they become coated in armor of ice or are they protected by a swarm of droids that surround them and deflect attacks?</p>

<p>When you browse these lists, you will find that your attributes grant access to far more banes and boons than you could typically make use of. Sometimes, attributes can mean different things for different types of characters. For example, imagine using the Alteration attribute to invoke the <em>shapeshift</em> boon - a Druid would do so to turn into a massive bear, while a genetically enhanced military operative might assume the identity of a high profile enemy commander. These examples of using <em>shapeshift</em> make sense and follow our normal expectations from similar stories, but Alteration also grants access to the <em>invisible</em> boon. This can be confusing, because having access to a bane or boon might make you feel that you should use it, but that’s not necessarily the case. The best time to use a bane or boon is when it adds to the story and makes the game more fun for everyone.</p>
<p>In Open Legend, we use the rules to make sure the game is fair and that everyone gets equal opportunity to drive the story forward—we don’t use the rules to ensure the game is logical. Whether or not a story makes sense or is enjoyable is a matter of personal preference. Open Legend expects that these details will be worked out between the players and the GM during a game. Certain attributes give you access to an incredible toolbox of banes and boons, but it is the responsibility of everyone playing the game to respect each other’s wish to tell a story that the group can get excited about. So, while your Druid with Alteration might not have a good excuse to become <em>invisible</em>, the rules make it possible just in case, and in the process it also becomes possible to play an alien psychic warrior that uses Alteration to bend waves of light and become <em>invisible</em>.</p>

<h2 id="invoking-banes-and-boons">Invoking Banes and Boons</h2>
<p>To invoke a bane, the primary method is to succeed at an appropriate attribute roll using one of your target’s defense scores as the Challenge Rating, as indicated in the bane description. An alternate method of invoking a bane is to make a successful damaging attack that exceeds the target’s defense by 10 or more. When this happens, you may apply one bane of a power level less than or equal to the attribute you used for the attack. In order to apply a bane, your attack roll must equal or exceed the appropriate defense for that bane. If your attack targeted multiple foes, you may apply the bane to each qualifying target. While targets may be affected by multiple banes, you may not <em>stack</em> banes. That is, a target cannot be inflicted with a bane it is currently suffering from, unless specified in the bane’s effect (<em>e.g.</em> <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/banes/fatigued">fatigued</a>).</p>
<p>To invoke a boon, you must succeed at an appropriate attribute roll with a Challenge Rating determined by the boon’s Power Level. The CR equals 10 + 2 x Power Level. If a boon can be invoked at multiple Power Levels, you decide which Power Level to invoke after making your action roll. While targets may be effected by different boons, you may not stack the same boon multiple times; if a second invocation of a boon would affect a character, they choose which boon to keep and which one to negate.</p>
<p>Additional details about invoking banes and boons, such as attack range and targeting multiple creatures, can be found in Chapter 7: Combat.</p>
<h2 id="reading-a-bane-description">Reading a Bane Description</h2>
<p>The full listing of banes are available in a searchable list <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/banes">here</a>.</p>
<p>Each bane description includes the following elements.</p>
<p><strong>Power Level.</strong> This number indicates the required attribute score needed to inflict the bane. If multiple power levels are listed (such as 2 / 4 / 6), then the bane can be inflicted at multiple tiers of power. The <em>persistent damage</em> bane, for example, deals increased damage as you inflict it at higher power levels.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Attributes.</strong> This is a list of the attribute or attributes that can be used to inflict the bane. As long as you possess at least one of the listed attributes at a score greater than or equal to the power level, then you can inflict the bane.</p>
<p><strong>Attack.</strong> This list indicates what type of attack roll to make when inflicting the bane. Each entry consists of an attribute that the attacking player should roll and the defense score targeted by the attack. If the attacker’s roll equals or exceeds the target’s defense score, then the bane is inflicted.</p>
<p><strong>Duration.</strong> A bane typically remains in effect until the target resists it by using the <em>resist banes</em> action, hence most banes have a duration of “resist ends”. If a target fails three resist rolls against a bane, the bane can no longer be resisted. It persists for an extended duration indicated in parentheses.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> This entry simply provides a general idea of what the bane could look like in the story.</p>
<p><strong>Effect.</strong> This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the bane on the rules of the game.</p>
<h2 id="reading-a-boon-description">Reading a Boon Description</h2>
<p>The full listing of boons are available in a searchable list <a href="http://www.openlegendrpg.com/boons">here</a>.</p>
<p>Each boon description includes the following elements.</p>
<p><strong>Power Level.</strong> This number indicates the required attribute score needed to invoke the boon. If multiple power levels are listed (such as 2 / 4 / 6), then the boon can be invoked at multiple tiers of power. The <em>heal</em> boon, for example, heals more damage as you invoke it at higher power levels. The power level of a boon also determines the Challenge Rating of the attribute roll to invoke the boon. The CR equals 10 + 2 x Power Level.</p>
<p><strong>Attributes.</strong> This is a list of the attribute or attributes that can be used to invoke the boon. As long as you possess at least one of the listed attributes at a score greater than or equal to the Power Level, then you can invoke the boon.</p>
<p><strong>Invocation Time.</strong> The required time that it takes to invoke the boon. Most boons have an invocation time of 1 major action. For boons that have a longer time, you must spend the entire invocation time concentrating on nothing other than invoking the boon. If you are interrupted, you must start the casting over.</p>
<p><strong>Duration.</strong> Most boons have a duration of “sustain persists”, which indicates that the invoker must use a sustain action every round in order to keep the boon in effect. If you have a boon in effect and don’t sustain it, the boon’s effects cease at the end of your turn. Because sustaining a boon is a minor action, which can only be taken once per turn, you can typically sustain only one boon at a time. You do not need to sustain a boon on the round in which it is invoked as long as you are not sustaining any other boons.</p>
<p><strong>Description.</strong> This entry simply provides a general idea of what the boon could look like in the story.</p>
<p><strong>Effect.</strong> This entry indicates the mechanical effects of the boon on the rules of the game.</p>
