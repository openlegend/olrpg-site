<h1 id="chapter-9-special-equipment">Chapter 9: Special Equipment</h1>
<p>Chapter 6 introduced you to the most common types of equipment your characters will make use of. In this chapter, we present rules for specialized equipment that won’t see quite as much play time. First, you’ll read about extraordinary items: weapons, armor, and other gear that is imbued with magic, forged with extraordinary skill, enhanced with superior technology, or otherwise granted power above and beyond that of mundane equipment. Then, you’ll read about mounts and vehicles that your characters can ride or pilot for enhanced mobility and additional tactical options.</p>
<h2 id="extraordinary-items">Extraordinary Items</h2>
<p>In Chapter 6, we talked about memorable and extraordinary items and how important they are in stories - items of power, such as King Arthur’s <strong>Excalibur</strong>, H.P Lovecraft’s <strong>Necronomicon</strong>, Thor’s hammer <strong>Mjolnir</strong>, and Frank Herbert’s <strong>“The Spice”</strong> (Melange) from the novel <em>Dune</em>. Many great stories hinge upon such relics, and in this section, we’ll show you how to create them for your Open Legend game.</p>
<p>In Open Legend, such items of power are called <em>extraordinary items</em> because they grant powers beyond those of mundane weapons, armor, and other gear.</p>
<h3 id="acquiring-extraordinary-items">Acquiring Extraordinary Items</h3>
<p>Extraordinary items can be acquired in a number of ways. They may be taken from the horde of a fallen enemy, gifted from a patron as a reward for a job well done, purchased from an obscure wandering merchant, or even crafted by a PC using the <em>Craft Extraordinary Item</em> feat.</p>
<p>However, extraordinary items are so powerful that they have the potential to dramatically alter the course of the story and the wielder’s capabilities. As such, they always require the approval of the GM to acquire. The GM can use an item’s wealth level as an indication of the relative strength of an extraordinary item, but the decision to allow a character to acquire such an item should depend on factors such as how much it adds to the story and how it affects the balance of power among all of the PCs.</p>
<h3 id="extraordinary-item-descriptions">Extraordinary Item Descriptions</h3>
<p>Extraordinary items are different from weapons, armor, and other gear because they give the wielder access to attributes, banes, and boons that are beyond their current power—or they bolster the attributes, banes, and boons that the wielder can already access. The Extraordinary Items Table outlines a variety of such items spanning many genres. The examples include weapons and gear of powerful magic, alchemy, and technology—and they should provide plenty of inspiration for coming up with your own extraordinary items for your campaign.</p>
<p><strong>WL (Wealth Level)</strong> indicates the wealth level associated with this extraordinary item. Acquiring the item requires a sufficient wealth level and follows all of the rules for wealth established in Chapter 6: Weapons &amp; Equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Attributes</strong> indicate which attributes, if any, the item can make use of. An item can use an attribute to make attacks, invoke banes and boons, and perform other actions that would reasonably fall within the item’s capabilities. The wielder spends their own actions to use an item’s attributes, but all attribute dice and power levels are determined by the item’s attribute score, not the wielder’s. The wielder’s applicable feats still apply. If the wielder’s attribute is greater than the item’s by one or two points, they may use their own attribute, and the item instead grants advantage 1 on rolls with that attribute. This bonus can only be applied once to a given attribute, regardless of how many items you wield that possess the attribute.</p>
<p><strong>Banes &amp; Boons</strong> indicate the banes and boons that the item grants access to. The wielder can use the item to invoke the listed bane or boon. The numeric value is used to determine both the power level and the attribute dice used for the invocation roll. The wielder may choose to invoke at a lower power level than that listed, in which case the attribute dice rolled are not reduced. All of the same rules for items with attributes apply, except in this case the granted access is for the listed banes or boons only.</p>
<p><strong>Properties</strong> are the descriptors that make each extraordinary item unique from others. These properties translate to specific game mechanics listed below.</p>

</table>
<h4 id="properties">Properties</h4>
<p><strong>Augmenting</strong> - Banes associated with this item can be delivered via an alternate method, such as a weapon or other damaging attack. Applying the item’s augmentation to an attack is a move action which consumes the item. Upon application, you choose a bane the item can invoke. The next attack made with the augmented item triggers that bane if your roll is <strong>equal to or above the target’s defense score</strong>. Examples of the <em>augmenting</em> property include poison, special ammo cartridges, and magical jewels that can be attuned to a weapon to enhance its power. All <em>augmenting</em> items must have the <em>expendable</em> property.</p>
<p><strong>Area</strong> - An item with the area property always makes multi-target area attacks or invocations of the listed size and shape and cannot be used to make non-area attacks. If an item has multiple area sizes, the attacker chooses from them with each attack. Attack and action rolls do not incur any of the disadvantage penalties usually associated with multi-targeting.</p>
<p><strong>Armor (type)</strong> - The item functions as a suit of armor of the given type, bestowing all of the benefits and restrictions of that armor upon the wearer.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous</strong> - When created, the item’s crafter sets a specific condition that causes the item to trigger one particular action. This autonomy could be magical guidance, algorithmic targeting via a guidance system, or even mundane autonomy, such as pressure plates surrounded by murder holes (arrow slits with self-reloading crossbows).</p>
<p><strong>Baneful (bane)</strong> - When making a damaging attack with this item, you may automatically inflict a listed bane if your attack roll exceeds the target’s defense by 5 or more. The bane can be triggered this way in lieu of other banes, even if the item or wielder cannot access the bane. The invoking attribute for this bane is equal to the attacking attribute.</p>
<p><strong>Consumable</strong> - A consumable item can be used once to invoke a boon at the listed power level. This boon invocation succeeds automatically without a roll and cannot be invoked with multi-targeting. Afterwards, the item is consumed and cannot be used again.</p>
<p><strong>Cursed (bane)</strong> - The wielder of this item is automatically afflicted with the indicated bane at the listed power level. The bane cannot be shaken off using the resist bane action. Furthermore, the cursed item cannot be unequipped unless the wielder is subject to the <em>restoration</em> boon at a power level high enough to dispel the bane.</p>
<p><strong>Damage (type)</strong> - When making a damaging attack with this item, you may choose to have it inflict damage of the listed type in lieu of the type it would otherwise deal. This property can only be applied to an item once. The damage types are: precise, forceful, fire, cold, lightning, acid, influence, and entropy, though a GM may allow or create other types.</p>
<p><strong>Deadly</strong> - Some weapons are so effective that their potency makes the wielder significantly more capable. Attacks made with this weapon gain advantage equal to their <em>deadly</em> value. A weapon cannot have a <em>deadly</em> value greater than 3.</p>
<p><strong>Expendable</strong> - An expendable item can be used once to make an attack or invoke a bane. Afterwards, the item is expended and cannot be used again.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent (boons)</strong> - An item with this property automatically invokes and sustains a single instance of the indicated boon without requiring the wielder to make an invocation roll or use the sustain a boon action. If the duration of a boon is instantaneous, the item automatically invokes the boon each round at the start of the wielder’s turn. The wielder does not have to invoke this effect. The item’s effect persists automatically unless the wielder spends a minor action to deactivate it, in which case it remains deactivated until the wielder spends a minor action to reactivate it.</p>
<p><strong>Potent</strong> - Targets suffer disadvantage 1 on resist rolls to shake off banes inflicted by this item.</p>
<p><strong>Powerful</strong> - Bane or boon invocations made with this item have advantage equal to the item’s <em>powerful</em> value. An item cannot have a <em>powerful</em> value greater than 3.</p>
<p><strong>Reliable</strong> - The wielder does not have to roll to invoke this item’s listed boons if they are targeting a single creature. The invocation automatically succeeds. If the item also has the <em>area</em> property, it may still benefit from the automatic success granted by the <em>reliable</em> property.</p>
<p><strong>Sentient</strong> - The item becomes either self-aware or capable of basic human reasoning. It has no inherent bond with its creator, and is treated like any other NPC. It gets its own turn and array of actions. The item gains no mental or social attributes, only the ability to think. At the GM’s discretion, it may also gain a particular mode of movement, such as walking, climbing, flying, or swimming.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> - The item possesses a unique property that is explained in full detail in its description.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon (type)</strong> - The item is a weapon of the given type. It possesses all of the properties of that weapon and can leverage them when making attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Properties</strong>: Mind Dredge 6</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: This apparatus must be carefully secured to the target. As such the target must first be unconscious, helpless, or immobile before a the <em>mind dredge</em> attack can be made.

<p><strong>Special</strong>: The UAI can only be removed by (illegal) surgery. The wielder always scans affirmatively as a high ranking government official, making them more persuasive via their rank. In addition, the UAI confers a wealth score of 6 for local purchases. Lastly, the device records every action performed by the user and transmits it to the creator. It has Perception 5, applied only to the user’s thoughts and actions. If the user fails a contested roll to conceal their intentions, the device will secretly send out an alert and attempt to persuade the user to alter their course of action.</p>

<h3 id="building-your-own-extraordinary-items">Building Your Own Extraordinary Items</h3>
<p>The extraordinary items already detailed are meant to serve as a starting point of inspiration for you to understand what these items look like so that you can create your own to fit your campaign. Building your own custom items is a simple four step process that involves deciding the attributes, banes, boons, and properties of the item and then determining an appropriate wealth level to represent the item’s overall power.</p>
<h4 id="step-1-choose-attributes-banes-boons">Step 1: Choose Attributes, Banes, &amp; Boons</h4>
<p>An extraordinary item can grant access to one or more attribute, bane, or boon. Choose any number of them.</p>
<p>Each attribute, bane, and boon increases the wealth level of the item according to the following tables.</p>

<h4 id="step-3-create-special-properties">Step 3: Create Special Properties</h4>
<p>In the previous step, you chose from the preset properties already created. Here, you can decide to give your item its own unique effects by creating your own special properties. Simply write a clear description of the mechanical effects of the item as well as any special conditions or restrictions that might apply.</p>
<p>After you have described your item’s special properties, you should assign a wealth level modifier by asking yourself several questions about each property:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Is it common?</strong> Will a character be able to make use of this property very often? If so, add wealth level +1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it versatile?</strong> Is the property useful in many different types of situations? If so, add wealth level +1.</p></li>
<li><strong>Is it powerful?</strong> Does the property create a significant advantage for a character or have the potential to impact the game in a very significant way? If so, add wealth level from +1 to +9.
<ul>
<li>A good way to decide how much of a modifier to apply is to compare the property to a bane or boon of similar effect. Then, use the table given in step 1 to determine a similar modifier based on the power level of that bane or boon.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it limiting?</strong> Does the property reduce the effectiveness of another ability or is it only useful in very specific situations? If so, reduce wealth level by 1.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="example-items-with-special-properties">Example Items with Special Properties</h3>
<p><br />
<strong>Hydraulic Propulsion Implants</strong><br />
<br />
You always count as having a running start for your jumps, and your distance covered when jumping is doubled.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it common?</em> No. Jumping will be useful in many combats, but only if the terrain and situation fits. Jumping might be useful in non-combat situations, but probably not that often.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it versatile?</em> Yes. +1 WL. Double jump distance will allow a character to overcome a large variety of obstacles, and provide enhanced maneuverability in both combat and non-combat scenarios.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it powerful?</em> Mildly. +1 WL. The maneuverability granted by this property is about on par to Teleport power level 3.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it limiting?</em> No. It doesn’t restrict other abilities nor is it limited to niche scenarios.<br />
<br />
<strong>Final WL Modifier</strong>: +2</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Shining Shield</strong><br />
<br />
Once per round, when the wielder of this shield is subject to a melee attack, they may make a <em>blinded</em> bane attack against the attacker. The item makes the following attack: Blinded 5 versus Guard.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it common?</em> Yes. +1 WL. If the wielder is a melee fighter, they have the potential to use this item every combat round.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it versatile?</em> No. The Shining Shield really only serves one purpose.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it powerful?</em> A little more powerful than an item with Blinded 5 because the Shining Shield allows you to inflict the bane without using an action. +3 WL.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it limiting?</em> No. While the Shining Shield is only useful when the wielder is targeted in melee, that situation is pretty common.<br />
<br />
<strong>Final WL Modifier</strong>: +4</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Assassin’s Rifle</strong><br />
<br />
This weapon has the Baneful (Blinded) and Baneful (Persistent Damage) properties. However, certain conditions must be met to use these properties. If your target is off guard, unaware, or within melee range of one of your allies, you can use the Baneful proprety .<br />
<br />
<em>Is it common?</em> Not any more common than any item that can inflict banes in the usual manner.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it versatile?</em> No. Even though the item has multiple instances of the <em>baneful</em> proprety, the cost of these is already accounted for in the properties.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it powerful?</em> Yes. It allows access to multiple banes that can be inflicted as part of an attack, so we calculate it the same as two instances of the <em>baneful</em> property. +3 WL <em>blinded</em> +2, WL <em>persistent damage</em>.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it limiting?</em> Yes. -1 WL. The target must meet certain conditions before the item can be used, so the attacker will often have to set these conditions up.<br />
<br />
<strong>Final WL Modifier</strong>: +4</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Helm of Goblin Bane</strong><br />
<br />
At the beginning of their turn, the wearer of this helm may take a free action to make a bane attack against all goblinoids within 100’ who can see the helm. The item makes the following attack: Fear 5 versus Resolve.<br />
<em>Is it common?</em> No. Unless the campaign takes place in a world overrun with goblins, a character will likely go entire sessions without being able to use this helm.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it versatile?</em> No. It only does one thing: scare goblins.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it powerful?</em> A little more powerful than an item with Fear 5 because it is activated as a free action. +3 WL.<br />
<br />
<em>Is it limiting?</em> Yes. The helm is only useful against a specific kind of creature. -1 WL.<br />
<br />
<strong>Final WL Modifier</strong>: +2</p>

<h4 id="step-4-calculate-final-wealth-level">Step 4: Calculate Final Wealth Level</h4>
<p>Calculate the total wealth level accrued in the previous steps. Then, compare the item to others of similar power. If necessary, adjust the wealth level up or down slightly so that it is an accurate representation of the item’s influence on the game compared to other extraordinary items. No extraordinary item can have a wealth level less than 1.</p>
<h2 id="legendary-items-list">Legendary Items List</h2>
<p>Legendary items are similar to extraordinary items in that they may provide access to attributes, banes, and boons. However, they are different in two ways: First, they have additional properties that cannot be found in extraordinary items. Second, they can confer such immense and unique powers that they often cannot be easily quantified with a wealth level.</p>
<h3 id="acquiring-legendary-items">Acquiring Legendary Items</h3>
<p>Legendary items should be more than mere rewards. When introduced into a new campaign, a legendary item should often serve the plot in a specific way. For example, perhaps the PCs come into possession of <em>Giant’s Bane</em>, a sentient bow containing the souls of four hunters of legend who have tried and failed to defeat the frost giants who have plagued the realm for a century. Equipped with such power and collective wisdom, the party stands a chance at succeeding where the previous hunters have failed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the GM should be prepared for the potentially campaign-altering power that legendary items possess. If you give the players a <em>Time Machine</em>, <em>Void Cannon</em>, or <em>Lamp of Wishes</em>, don’t be surprised when they use them to their full potential—and don’t try to railroad them into only using legendary items in specific situations if the item obviously has greater potential.</p>
<h3 id="attributes-banes-and-boons">Attributes, Banes, and Boons</h3>
<p>Legendary items use the same rules as extraordinary items when it comes to granting attributes, banes, and boons.</p>
<h3 id="properties-1">Properties</h3>
<p>Legendary items may possess any of the same properties as extraordinary items. Additionally, they may have any of the following properties.</p>
<p><strong>Attribute <em>bonus/penalty</em></strong> - When wielding the item, the owner’s attribute is increased or decreased by the amount indicated.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligent</strong> - The item is sentient and possesses its own psyche and personality, including mental and social attributes. It also has the ability to communicate audibly or telepathically. The item description will detail any attribute scores as well as communication limits (such as the ability to only communicate with the wielder).</p>
<p><strong>Unfailing</strong> - Any dice rolled when using this item’s abilities treat a result of 1 as a result of the maximum instead. Rolling a 1 also results in a dice explosion just as if the die had rolled maximum. So, for example, rolling a 1 on a d8 would be treated as an 8. A 1 on a d20 would be a 20.</p>
<p><strong>Slaying (creature type)</strong> - When the item is used to make a damaging attack against the indicated creature type and exceeds the target’s defense by 5 or more, the target immediately dies.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="some-things-money-cant-buy">Some Things, Money Can’t Buy</h4>
<p>Possessing a legendary item marks a dramatic shift in the capability and power of a given character. As such, these items are too valuable to be bought, and unlikely to find a buyer unless you want to sell them for a fraction of their value. It is typically the most fun for everyone if players discover these powerful items as part of a quest, or an unexpected reward for achieving a dramatic milestone in a story arc. GMs can even ask their players what kind of powerful artifact or relic they envision being most suited to their character. No character should ever begin play with access to an artifact or a relic.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="void-cannon">Void Cannon</h4>
<p><em>This universe shattering weapon of far future technology can literally tear holes in space time. When fired at full charge, the Void Cannon tears a rift in the fabric of spacetime, manifesting as a concentrated beam of annihilation that wipes from existence anything in its path.</em></p>
<p><strong>Weapon</strong>: Normally, the Void Cannon functions as a weapon with the following statistics and properties: medium ranged, precise, deadly 3, delayed ready, area 10’ cube, banes: persistent damage.</p>
<p><strong>Void</strong>: The wielder may fire the cannon at full blast by spending 2 uninterrupted rounds using a focus action to charge its power. On the third round, the wielder may use another focus action to fire the beam, which targets a 10’ wide line up to the weapon’s maximum range. Objects and structures in the area of effect are completely obliterated from existence. Creatures must make an Agility roll, CR 15 or suffer the same fate. On a successful roll, they suffer 50 damage. Once fired at full blast, the Void Cannon cannot function at all for 24 hours.</p>
<h4 id="giants-bane">Giant’s Bane</h4>
<p><em>This unassuming longbow hides a secret power. It contains the souls of four hunters of legend who failed in the past to defeat the frost giants that have oppressed the realm for a hundred years. Longing for both vengeance and a proper rest, the hunters cannot move on to the afterlife until the giant lord is slain.</em></p>
<p><strong>Properties:</strong> Weapon (Longbow), Deadly 2, Slaying (giants), Agility +1, Perception +2, Intelligent</p>
<p><strong>Intelligent</strong>: The bow can communicate telepathically with anyone within 30’, and contains four distinct personalities of heroes past. The GM is free to develop these personalities as much as desired, but they are all eager to amend their past failure to defeat the giants. As long as the party is working towards this goal, the spirits willingly share their wealth of information about the giants’ previous tactics, locations, numbers, and such. Once the giant king is slain, the spirits are released from the bow. From that point forward, it becomes an extraordinary item with the properties Weapon (Longbow) and Deadly 2. In addition, it grants an additional advantage 2 on all attacks against giants.</p>
<h4 id="infinity-suit">Infinity Suit</h4>
<p><em>It is said that deep in the far reaches of spaces, abandoned on a remote moon, lies the Infinity Suit, a mech unit so powerful that the pilot becomes nigh indestructible.</em></p>
<p><strong>Properties:</strong> Armor (power armor), Might 8, Bolster 6 (Might), Regeneration 9, Flight 8, Persistent</p>
<p><strong>Indestructible:</strong> While wearing the Infinity Suit, the pilot is immune to lethal damage and any effects that cause immediate death. Furthermore, the pilot gains 30 additional hit points while wearing the Infinity Suit.</p>
<h4 id="lamp-of-wishes">Lamp of Wishes</h4>
<p><em>When rubbed, this dusty old lamp spews forth an ancient genie of unimaginable power, ready to do the owner’s bidding. However, the genie’s services are often served with a bit of mischief on the side.</em></p>
<p><strong>Properties:</strong> Presence +3</p>
<p><strong>Wishes</strong>: The genie will grant the owner of the lamp 3 wishes. The genie will often twist or interpret wishes in such a way that the owner gets what they asked for in a completely unfavorable way. For example, if a person wishes to be king of the realm, the genie may transport him upon the throne 1000 years into the future, where the kingdom is a desolate wasteland. Once the lamp has been claimed, a new owner cannot be had until all three wishes are used. After all three wishes have expired, the lamp transports to a completely random point in the world.</p>
<h4 id="reaver">Reaver</h4>
<p><em>This vicious axe features a serrated blade atop an ebony haft carved with screaming faces. When swung in combat, it sends forth an otherworldly warble that strikes terror in the hearts of the wielder’s foes.</em></p>
<p><strong>Properties:</strong> Weapon (battle axe), Fear 8, Might +2, Presence +2, Unfailing</p>
<p><strong>Warble</strong>: Any foe that starts its turn within 10’ of the wielder automatically suffers the demoralized bane at power level 8.</p>
<h4 id="staff-of-the-archmage">Staff of the Archmage</h4>
<p><em>Carved from the oak of the World Tree and set with gems from the elemental planes, this staff is one of the most powerful additions to an evoker’s arsenal.</em></p>
<p><strong>Properties:</strong> Energy 7, Energy +2, Potent, Persistent Damage 9, Baneful (Persistent Damage)</p>
<p><strong>Retributive Strike</strong>: The wielder may willingly break the staff to unleash its power in a devastating blast of elemental energy. The wielder is immediately killed, and creatures within 100 feet suffer a damaging attack as follows: 1d20 + 4d8, advantage 9 versus Guard.</p>
<h4 id="time-machine">Time Machine</h4>
<p><em>The ultimate achievement of mad scientists and quantum physicists alike, this vehicle is capable of transporting its passengers through the fourth dimension.</em></p>
<p><strong>Time Travel</strong>: A character may attempt to travel forward or backward in time by making a Logic roll, CR 20. The roll incurs disadvantage 1 for every 5 years of time travel. Any passengers within the vehicle are also transported, willing or not. The GM may interpret a failed roll in any number of interesting ways, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The time travelled is multiplied by 100.</p></li>
<li><p>The machine instead transports the passengers to a different dimension.</p></li>
<li><p>The direction of time travel is reversed.</p></li>
<li><p>The travelers miss the mark by 2d4 years.</p></li>
<li><p>The travelers are attacked by a horde of 4th dimensional chrono beasts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<h2 id="mounts-vehicles">Mounts &amp; Vehicles</h2>
<p>In this section, you’ll find rules for mounting upon your battle-bred warhorse or piloting your trusty old fighter ship. For mechanical purposes, mounts and vehicles are handled the same. These rules will apply whenever a character is riding upon or within another creature or object as their primary form of movement. You will move with your mount (see mount actions below), but otherwise you are considered separate for purposes of targeting, boons, banes, and similar situations.</p>
<p>Throughout this text, the words “mount” and “vehicle” are used interchangeably. Mechanically speaking, the rules are the same whether you are riding a pony or a star fighter, so any references to “mount” also apply to “vehicles”, and vice-versa.</p>
<h3 id="mount-actions">Mount Actions</h3>
<p>When mounted, you may allocate any of your actions to your mount instead of yourself. For example, while riding a velociraptor, you could spend your move action to have your raptor move 40’. Whenever your mount moves, you move with it. Likewise, instead of attacking with your own weapons, you could spend your major action to let your raptor make an attack. Your mount will have its own attributes and feats, so it will not benefit from your feats or attributes.</p>
<p>Typically, mounts and vehicles cannot act independently of their riders, and so they will only get to take actions when their rider allocates actions to them.</p>
<h3 id="example-mounts-vehicles">Example Mounts &amp; Vehicles</h3>
<p>Detailed below are a variety of mounts and vehicles to carry your characters across land, sea, sky, and space. These samples represent multiple genres and are not meant to be an exhaustive list. GMs and players should use these examples as guidelines and work together to create stats for additional mounts as necessary to fit their campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>WL (Wealth Level)</strong> indicates the wealth level associated with this particular mount or vehicle. Acquiring one requires a sufficient wealth level and follows all of the rules for wealth established in Chapter 6: Wealth &amp; Equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Speed</strong> indicates the number of feet the mount or vehicle moves with a single move action.</p>
<p><strong>Properties</strong> are the descriptors that make each mount unique from others. These properties translate to specific game mechanics described below.</p>
<p><strong>Attributes</strong> indicates the notable attributes possessed by the vehicle or mount. At the GM’s discretion, other attributes can be granted on an as-needed basis.</p>
<p><strong>Feats</strong> indicates the feats which the mount or vehicle possesses to highlight its unique capabilities. These feats only apply to actions taken by the mount, not actions made by the rider.</p>
<p><strong>HP (Hit Points)</strong> indicates the total hit points possessed by the vehicle or mount.</p>
<p><strong>DT (Damage Threshold)</strong> is an indication of how much punishment the mount or vehicle can take. When a vehicle reaches zero hit points, it gains one damage level and its hit points return to maximum. Any remaining damage is carried over to the its new hit point total. Thus, a vehicle can suffer multiple damage levels from a single attack. A mount has disadvantage equal to its damage level on all action rolls. Once the mount’s damage level reaches its damage threshold, it is disabled (unable to act) until healed or repaired. Repairing or healing one damage level requires 1 day per wealth level of the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Defenses</strong> are the Toughness, Guard, and Resolve defenses of the vehicle or mount. If “Immune” is listed for a given defense, then attacks targeting that defense have no effect.</p>
<h4 id="properties-2">Properties</h4>
<p><strong>Faster than Light</strong> - The vehicle is capable of traveling faster than the speed of light. Doing so requires that a pilot expend a focus action on three consecutive rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Guided Weapons</strong> - Attacks made with this vehicle are particularly difficult to evade. When the vehicle makes an attack using an attribute greater than zero, it rolls an additional d20 and keeps the higher die. This benefit only applies to attacks that target the Guard defense.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Pilot</strong> - The vehicle can be piloted by a number of people equal to the value indicated. Each pilot can make use of the vehicle to make actions, but no more than 2 move actions can be taken by the vehicle in each round.</p>
<p><strong>Independent</strong> - A mount or vehicle with this property is capable of acting on its own, without the instructions of its controller. It receives a number of major actions every round equal to the value indicated. These cannot be used to perform move actions. The rider may still assign actions to the mount as usual.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted Weapons</strong> - A vehicle with this property is more potent in the hands of a skilled operator. If the pilot’s Agility score is greater than the attacking attribute score of the vehicle, attacks receive advantage equal to the difference. Attacks are still made by the vehicle and not the pilot.</p>
